    <dfn><h1>Programming Language</h1></dfn>
    <abbr><p style="font-size: 24px;">A programming language is a formal set of rules and instructions that lets humans communicate tasks and commands to a computer, enabling the creation of software, apps, and scripts</p></abbr>
    <p> Programming Languages are two types:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Interpreted Languages</li>
        <p>Interpreted languages are programming languages in which the source code is executed line by line or instruction by instruction directly by an interpreter program, without being first compiled into machine code. This means the computer runs the code on the fly, translating each instruction as it is encountered during runtime.</p>
          <ol style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            <li>Ruby</li>
          </ol>
          <br>
        <li>Compiled Languages</li>
        <p>A compiled language is a programming language where the source code you write is first translated by a compiler into machine code (binary instructions) that the computer's processor can execute directly. This compilation step happens before the program is run, creating an executable file independent of the source code.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li> C</li>

            <li>Go</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>

         <ul>
            <li>It is interpreted, meaning code runs line-by-line without needing separate compilation.</li>
            <li>It supports multiple programming styles: procedural, object-oriented, and functional.</li>
            <li>It uses indentation (spaces/tabs) to define blocks of code instead of braces.</li>
         </ul>
        <li>Java</li>

         <ul>
            <li>Object-Oriented – Uses classes, objects, and OOP principles.</li>
            <li>Platform Independent – “Write Once, Run Anywhere” via JVM.</li>
            <li>Simple Syntax – Easier to learn; avoids complex features like pointers.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>C++</li>

         <ul>
            <li>Object-Oriented – Supports classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.</li>
            <li>High & Low-Level Features – Combines advanced abstraction with direct hardware access</li>
            <li>Compiled Language – Fast execution and efficient resource use.</li>
